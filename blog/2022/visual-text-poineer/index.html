Additionally, we also conduct both qualitative and quantitative analysis between three methods.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Recent papers have shown the success of adapting LLMs to vision-language tasks with a small amount of fine-tuning required. Various methods are proposed for bridging visual and text modalities. Nonetheless, the comparison and analysis among them are rarely studied. To this end, we plan to write a blog post to give a kind introduction and summary of recent approaches for vision-language adaption for LLM. Although there are lots of related works in recent years, they basically fall into three categories: <em>query-based</em>, <em>projection-based</em>, and <em>parameter-efficient tuning</em> approaches (following definitions in<d-cite key="yin2023survey"></d-cite>). For each of the categories, we select one representative work for our blog post.</p> <p>In this blog post, we first give detailed introductions to each representative work individually. Then we show some qualitative and quantitative analysis done by ourselves and provied some conclusion from those results.</p> <h2 id="method">Method</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Categories</th> <th>Query-based</th> <th>Projection-based</th> <th>Parameter-Efficient Tuning</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Selected model</th> <th>InstructBLIP<d-cite key="instructblip"></d-cite> </th> <th>LLaVA<d-cite key="liu2023llava"></d-cite> </th> <th>LLaMA-Adapter<d-cite key="zhang2023llamaadapter"></d-cite> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Is the extracted image features conditioned on text?</td> <td>✔</td> <td>❌</td> <td>❌</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Where are the two modalities concatenated?</td> <td>At the input of LLM</td> <td>At the input of LLM</td> <td>At each adapters in multiple layers of LLM</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Is the model pretrained on image-caption dataset?</td> <td>✔</td> <td>✔</td> <td>❌</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Trainable Params</td> <td>188M</td> <td>7B</td> <td>1.2M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ScienceQA Results (Acc %)</td> <td>79.5</td> <td>90.9</td> <td>85.2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="caption"> Comparison for the three selected models.

In BLIP-2, they propose a lightweight Querying Transformer (Q-Former) to bridge the gap between image and text modalities. The learnable queries learn to extract text-related features from the image in pre-trained stage. In InstructBLIP, they formulate instruction-tuning dataset and propose a Instruction-aware Visual Feature Extraction to extend Q-Former from BLIP-2.</p> <h4 id="q-former">Q-Former</h4> <p>Q-Former is a trainable module to bridge the gap between a frozen image encoder and a frozen LLM. There are two transformer submodules (1) an image transformer and (2) a text transformer that share the same self-attention layers. A set of learnable queries is sent as input to the image transformer, interacting with frozen image features through cross-attention layers. Q-Former is pre-trained in two stages as belows:</p> <h4 id="bootstrap-vision-language-representation-learning-from-a-frozen-image-encoder">Bootstrap Vision-Language Representation Learning from a Frozen Image Encoder</h4> <blockquote> <p>Extract visual representation that is most informative of the text.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the representation learning stage, Q-Former is connected to a frozen image encoder and perform pre-training using image-text pairs. The goal is to enable queries to extract visual representation that is most relevent to the text. There are three learning objectives, each one employs different attention masking strategy between queries and text.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage1.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure from <d-cite key="li2023blip2"></d-cite>.

Specifically, it aligns the output query representation Z and output [CLS] token in text transformer. Then, compute pair-wise similarity between each query output and [CLS] and select the highest one as the image-text similarity.</p> </li> <li>Image-grounded Text Generation (ITG) <blockquote> <p>Given image as condition, generate the text.</p> </blockquote> <p>It learns to generate the text from image features extracted by the queries. So the queries are forced to extract visual features that capture all the information about the text. Here it employs causual self-attention mask where the queries cannot attend to the text tokens while the text tokens can attend to all queries and previuos text tokens.</p> </li> <li>Image-Text Matching (ITM) <blockquote> <p>Binary classification whether an image-text pair is matched.</p> </blockquote> <p>It learns the fine-grained alignment betwen image and text. It uses a bi-directional attention where all queries and text tokens can attend to each other and the output query embeddings with multimodal information will be fed into linear classifier to predict whether the image-text pair is matched(positive) or unmatched(negative).</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="bootstrap-vision-to-language-generative-learning-from-a-frozen-llm">Bootstrap Vision-to-Language Generative Learning from a Frozen LLM</h4> <p>In the generative pre-training stage, we connect QFormer(with the frozen image encoder attached) to a frozen LLM. The output query embeddings are projected to the same dimension as the text embeddings of the LLM. Then, the projected query embeddings are prepended to the input text embeddings as ‘soft prompt’. There are two types of LLMs: decoder-based and encoder-decoder based as the below figure shows.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/BLIP2_Q-Former_stage2.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure from <d-cite key="li2023blip2"></d-cite>.

In LLaVA <d-cite key="liu2023llava"></d-cite>, the authors proposed an end-to-end multimodal model that bridges the gap between an off-the-shelf vision encoder and Large Language Model (LLM) by mapping the representations of the vision model to the same higher dimensional textual embedding space. The authors also curated a Multimodal instruction following data by utilizing language-only GPT-4 model. In Llava-1.5 <d-cite key="liu2023improved"></d-cite> the authors claim that due to the fact that LLaVA has not been pre-trained on large-scale data, as other similar approaches like query-based methods do (add citation here), the performance of Llava model is undermined. Moreover, LLaVA model suffers from balancing between short- and long-form VQA tasks. To address these issues, the authors used prompt engineering by formatting the response formats and also, increased the complexity of projector layers.</p> <h4 id="contributions-of-llava-">Contributions of LLaVA <d-cite key="liu2023llava"></d-cite> </h4> <ul> <li>The paper highlights that the amount of multimodal data (text, image) pairs have increased over time. However, the amount of instruction following multimodal data is still limited because the process is time-consuming and not well structured for human crowd source data collection. Therefore, the paper utilized language only GPT-4 model to generate three different type of data (conversation styled, detailed description, compelx reasoning) by only prompting the model with image description and the bounding box of the object present in the image.</li> <li>Secondly, the authors presented an end-to-end model using off-the-shelf image encoder (Clip Visual encoder ViT-L/14) and LLM (Llama) by mapping the representations of the vision model to the same higher dimensional textual embedding space using a linear projection layer.</li> </ul> <h4 id="gpt-4-assisted-visual-instruction-data-generation">GPT-4 Assisted Visual Instruction Data Generation</h4> <p>The authors utilized language GPT-4 model to generate visual instruction tuned data for (image, text) pairs by prompting the GPT-4 model with features of image such as description of scenario and objects in the image and bounding box data of the objects in the image. Then, the model is seeded with a couple of manually curated data. Three type of instruction-following data is collected:</p> <ul> <li> <em>Conversation</em> <blockquote> <p>A conversation between assistant and a person asking questions about a given photo. The answers are in a tone as if the assistant is seeing the image and answering the questions. Questions asked include object types, counting the objects, object actions, relative positions between objects.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <em>Detailed Description</em> <blockquote> <p>A list of questions is curated that prompt GPT-4 to answer in a more detail way about the image.

However, to effectively leverage their capabilites (i.e., jointly use the information captured by vision and language embeddings), the embeddings have to be mapped closer in the same higher dimensional space. For an input image \(X_v\), a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder ViT/L-14 is used to extract the visual features \(Z_v = g(X_v)\). The model uses grid features before and after the last Transformer layer for experiments. To convert, the extracted visual features and to provide conditioning to the text, the features are mapped to the space of text token embeddings via a single linear layer. Specifically, \(Z_v\) is converted to \(H_v\) via the learnable matrix \(W\) i.e., \(H_v = W * Z_v\).</p> <h4 id="training-of-llava-model">Training of LLaVA Model</h4> <p>The data to instruct tune the model is generated as: For each image \(X_v\), multi-turn conversation data is generated as a sequence \(( X_q^1, X_a^1 , \dots, X_q^T, X_a^T )\) where \(T\) represents the total number of turns. At iteration \(t\), the model is given \(X_{instruct}^t\) which is defined as : <br></p> <p>\(X_{instruct}^t = \begin{cases} \text{Random choice } [X_v, X_q^1] \text{ or } [X_q^1, X_v] &amp; t=1 \\ X_q^t &amp; t &gt; 1 \\ \end{cases}\)<br> <br> Instruction tuning is performed on LLM on the prediction tokens via the original auto-regressive training objective. Specifically, model is fine tuned for the loss signal that is generated on predicted <strong>answer tokens</strong>. The model training is done in two steps:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Feature alignment Phase</strong>: In order to instruction tune the model, the first thing is to be able to learn the mapping between image encoder features to text embeddings. This is done by using filtered data from CC3M dataset to get $595$ K image-text pairs. These pairs can be converted to a single turn instruction-following data by associating a <em><strong>conversation</strong></em> style question. Both the visual encoder and LLM weights are frozen, and the likelihood of answer is maximized given the image and instruction (question) by training the linear layer parameter i.e., $\theta = W$. <strong>This step essentially then aligns the image features with pre-trained LLM word embeddings.</strong> </li> <li> <strong>Fine-tuning End-to-End</strong>: This step only keeps the weights of visual encoder frozen, and continue to update both the projection layer weights and the pre-trained LLM weights. Two specific use case scenarios are considered: <ul> <li> <em>Multimodal Chatbot</em>: $158$ K unique language-image conversation styled collected multi-turn data is used for training. Uniform sampling is done from this dataset.</li> <li> <em>Science QA</em>: Science QA dataset is used to train the model for generating the reasoning process in natural language and then selecting the answer from the multiple choices.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="experiments">Experiments</h4> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llava_base_exp-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llava_base_exp-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llava_base_exp-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llava_base_exp.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Table from <d-cite key="liu2023llava"></d-cite> </div> <p>The experimental analysis showed that LLaVA achieved SOTA performance on mean accuracy on ScienceQA compared to other methods such as Chain-Of-Thought (COT) and LLaMA-Adapter.</p> <h4 id="llava-15-">LLaVA-1.5 <d-cite key="liu2023improved"></d-cite> </h4> <p><strong>Contributions of LLaVA-1.5</strong></p> <p>The base architecture of LLaVA is kept intact but the following modifications are made:</p> <ul> <li>CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projector is used instead of previously used visual encoder and a single linear projection layer.</li> <li>Academic-task-oriented VQA data with prompt engineering</li> </ul> <p>The authors claim that LLaVA model was falling short on academic benchmakrs that typically require short-form answers.

To incorporate visual information into pretrained LLMs, we can also use adapters. Adapters are common techniques for finetuning large models for downstream tasks. The main concept of adapters is that rather than tuning the entire model, we inject learnable lightweight parameters in different layers of the large model. By doing so, we can steer the pretrained model to a new downstream task. The advantage is that, by injecting adapters into deep layers of LLM, we can change the representation in different depths of the model without the need to update deep layers. The visual information is integrated into the LLaMA model by adding different scales of CLIP image encoder<d-cite key="clip2021"></d-cite> outputs to the learnable adapter prompts.</p> <p>In the LLaMA Adapter, they propose a new training method <strong>Zero-init Gated Attention</strong>. When fintuning with adapters in the early training stage, it is often unstable. The reason is that the pretrained model has not yet learned how to utilize the newly injected adapter modules. To this end, in the LLaMA adapter, the authors introduce a gating factor \(\mathbf{g}_l\) on the adapter part of the attention score before multiplying the values in the attention layer. Their ablation studies further substantiate the advantage of this proposed method.</p> <p>The contributions of LLaMA can be summarized as the following:</p> <ul> <li>1.2M tunable params required to achieve comparable abilities of 7B Alpaca(Fully fintuned on LLaMA 7B)</li> <li>Train less than 1 hour on 8 A100 GPU 3x faster than Alpaca</li> <li>More flexible to switch adapters than train the whole model</li> <li>Enable to perform multimodal tasks: ScienceQA and COCO Captions</li> <li>Zero-initialized Attention can mitigate early-stage unstability and can be generalized to other traditional vision and language models</li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_overview-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_overview-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_overview-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_overview.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The overview of LLaMA-Adapter Architecture.

Now, let’s consider the last timestep for attention calculation. \(\mathbf{Q}_t\) is the query vector of the last timestep, \(\mathbf{K}_l\) are the key vectors of the entire input sequence (\(K+M+1\)), \(\mathbf{V}_l\) are the value vectors of the entire input sequence (\(K+M+1\))</p> <p>To calculate the attention score for the last timestep query to all keys \(\mathbf{S}_l\), we simply do a dot product \(\mathbf{Q}_l\) and \(\mathbf{K}_l\) and normalize it by \(\sqrt{C}\).</p> <p>Notice that the upper part(first \(K\) rows) of the attention scores \(\mathbf{S}_l\) is affected by adapter prompt (\([\mathbf{P}_1...\mathbf{P}_k]\)) while the rest of them aren’t. To let the model gradually utilize the adaption prompt, the author multiplies the upper part with a learnable gating factor \(\mathbf{g}_l\). The softmax function is applied separately for the upper and lower parts of \(\mathbf{S}_l\) rather than on the whole vector. The reason is that we don’t want the values on the lower part(original attention) to be affected by the values on the upper part(adapter prompts).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_attention1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_attention1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_attention1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/llama_adapter_attention1.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> In their implementation code, the gating factor is different for each layer and each attention head. </div> <p>Finally, the modified attention scores are then used to perform a weighted sum over the entire values vector sequence to get the final hidden state for the last timestep.

This task evaluates the model’s capacity to capture the uncommon part and interpret it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implicit Relationship Inference:</p> <p>In this advanced category, the model is presented with subtle visual cues and need to infer the implicit relationships that are not immediately apparent.

However, since LLaVA and LLaMA-Adapter does not use text-conditioning while training the visual embedding extractor the embeddings are well separated.</p> <h2 id="quantitative-analysis-image-to-text-retrieval">Quantitative Analysis-Image-to-Text Retrieval</h2> <p>In this section, we conducted a study to analyze if we can extract the corresponding text embeddings from the image embeddings in the original mapped space of \(\mathbf{R}^{4096}\). For that, we used the same setup as explained in the previous section and used the \(200\) image-text pairs from the validation split of <strong>VQA-v2</strong> dataset. We then computed the cosine similarity for each image embedding with all the text embeddings and extracted the top \(k\) text embeddings with the highest cosine similarity. We then computed the accuracy of the model by checking if the corresponding text embedding is present in the top \(k\) text embeddings. The results are shown in the following figure. From the figure, it can be seen that Instruct Blip has the perfect retrieval accuracy which indicates that text conditioning based image embedding extraction is beneficial for the model. However, LLaVA and LLaMA-Adapter have a retrieval accuracy which is at par with the random retrieval accuracy.</p> <div class="row mt-1"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/retrieval-acc-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/retrieval-acc-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/retrieval-acc-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/img/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer/retrieval-acc.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="quantitative-analysis-unified-framework">Quantitative Analysis-Unified Framework</h2> <p>In the comparison among the three methods, their individual use of diverse settings and datasets for training makes direct comparisons challenging.

We used CLIP-ViT for the image encoder and Vicuna-7B for the LLM. Vicuna is a decoder-only Transformer instruction-tuned from LLaMA. Both the image encoder and the LLM are frozen during the training. We used VQAv2 for training and validation.</p> <p>There are two changing factors in our ablation study:</p> <ol> <li>Text-conditioning on the Q-Former.</li> <li>Integrating an adapter into multiple LLM layers or merely concatenating image embeddings with text embeddings in the LLM input.</li> </ol> <p>The results are shown below. For the VQAv2 dataset, we’ve recorded the top-1 accuracy percentages for different models and conditions. When utilizing an adapter, we observed a 61.83% accuracy with conditional text, slightly higher than 61.47% without it. However, removing the conditional text resulted in a decrease to 58.59% without the adapter and an increase to 60.55% with it.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th>VQAv2 - top-1 accuracy (%)</th> <th> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td>W/ Adapter</td> <td>W/O Adapter</td> </tr> <tr> <td>W/ Conditional Text</td> <td>61.83</td> <td>61.47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>W/O Conditional Text</td> <td>58.59</td> <td>60.55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LLaVA-1.5 (7B)</td> <td>–</td> <td>78.5*</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>From these observations, two conclusions emerge:</p> <ol> <li>Text-conditioning marginally improves performance.</li> <li>The impact of the adapter is contingent on text-conditioning.</li> </ol> <p>The initial conclusion suggests that conditioning on text bolsters the extraction of image features, aligning them more closely with the text for enhanced question-answering capabilities. Regarding the latter, it’s plausible that since the adapter adjusts image features across multiple layers, the efficacy is amplified when conditioned on text, ensuring the quality of extracted image embeddings.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/VisualTextPioneer/assets/bibliography/2022-12-01-visual-text-poineer.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
